var num = 33;
var isEven = num % 2 === 0; // i think this is saying that we have a variable isEven to determine if the number is even. We use the modulator sign to help use determine this
console.log(isEven); // False. 33 is an odd number comes out with the remainder 1
console.log(!isEven); // True. Not even
